refactor: translate API handling modules to English

Translated all API and authentication modules from Arabic to English to enhance code readability and maintainability. This includes renaming functions, variables, and in-code comments.

Affected files:
- src/js/api.js
- src/js/auth.js
- src/admin/js/api.js
- src/admin/js/auth.js

This change is part of the ongoing effort to standardize codebase language and improve collaboration for non-Arabic speaking developers.
